# Clean Green Turf — Website Migration

## What this project is

Migrating cleangreenturf.com off Hostinger Horizons (AI site builder) to a
custom PHP/HTML/CSS/JS site, version-controlled in this GitHub repo, hosted
on Hostinger. This is a **migration**, not a redesign-from-scratch: the live
site is the source of truth for URLs, content, metadata, headings, internal
links, images, schema, tracking, and forms.

**Full requirements are non-negotiable and live in
[`docs/migration-requirements.md`](docs/migration-requirements.md). Read it
before making any structural, URL, or content-removal decision.**

## The rule that overrides convenience

Preservation is the default. If a change would delete a page, change a URL,
consolidate pages, remove substantial copy/links/schema, or change
canonicalization/heading targeting — stop and flag it instead of just doing
it because it's cleaner. See requirement #33 in the doc above.

## Two-phase approach

1. **Preserve** — reproduce the existing site's URLs/content/SEO/tracking in
   the new PHP architecture exactly. Nothing new yet.
2. **Improve** — only after Phase 1 is verified against the migration
   inventory: performance, UX, conversion, new Repair/Installation pages,
   location-page strategy, schema upgrades, internal linking.

## Key artifacts to maintain as work proceeds

- `docs/url-inventory.md` (or .csv) — every existing URL: title, H1, meta
  description, canonical, migration action (default: KEEP URL UNCHANGED).
- `docs/redirect-map.md` — any old→new 301s, each with a documented reason.
- `/includes/` — shared PHP (header, footer, navigation, cta, schema,
  business-info config) so NAP/tracking IDs/etc. exist in exactly one place.
- `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` — canonical, indexable URLs only.

## Architecture constraints

- No `.php` extensions exposed in public URLs (route/rewrite via `.htaccess`).
- Minimal JS, no heavy framework unless there's a real functional need.
- Force HTTPS, one canonical host (confirm www vs non-www from the live
  site before assuming), no duplicate-access paths.
- Never commit secrets (SMTP creds, API keys, Hostinger creds). Use a
  `.gitignore` and a config mechanism kept out of git for anything sensitive.

## Current status

See task list / conversation for live progress. As of project start: doing
a full inventory crawl of the live site before writing any new code.
